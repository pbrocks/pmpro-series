Requires at least: 3.4

Stable tag: .3.7

Create "Series" which are groups of posts/pages where content is revealed to members over time. This is the "drip feed content" module for Paid Memberships Pro.

== Description ==
This plugin currently requires Paid Memberships Pro.

How this plugin works:

1. There will be a new "Series" tab in the Memberships menu of the WP dashboard.
2. Admins can create a new "Series".
3. Admins can add a page or post to a series along with a # of days after signup.
4. Admins can add a series to a membership level.
5. Admins can adjust the email template via an added page to their active theme.

Then...

1. User signs up for a membership level that gives him access to Series A.
2. User gets access to any "0 days after" series content.
3. Each day a script checks if a user should gain access to any new content, if so:
- User is given access to the content.
- An email is sent to the user letting them know that content is available.

Checking for access:
* Is a membership level required?
* If so, does the user have one of those levels?
* Is the user's level "assigned" to a series?
* If so, does the user have access to that content yet? (count days)
* If not, then the user will have access. (e.g. Pro members get access to everything right away.)

Checking to send emails:
* For all members with series levels.
* What day of the membership is it?
* For all series.
* Get content.
* Send content for this day.
* Email update.

Data Structure
* Series is a CPT
* Use wp_pmpro_memberships_pages to link to membership levels
* wp_pmpro_series_content (series_id, post_id, day) stored in post meta

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-series` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Navigate to the Series menu in the WordPress dashboard to create a new series.
1. Add posts to series using the "Posts in this Series" meta box under the post content.
